# Color_variations_microlensing

All C++  codes calculate the variation in the stellar colors during lensing events due to elliptical source stars,  limb-darkened source stars,  
spotted source stars, and blending source stars. Through these codes we studied if these chromatic signatures can be discerned through 
observations by Lucky Imaging camera on the Danish telescope.  

I note that the codes use the VBBinaryLensing package to calculate the magnification factor due to either extended source stars, or binary lens systems. 

There are two python codes, those plot lightcurves.
